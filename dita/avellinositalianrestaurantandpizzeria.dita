They have so many specialty pizza options, making it possibly difficult but fun to choose! They bake their pizzas to perfection, providing us with a warm, crispy delight. With very generous portions, you will never leave feeling hungry, and instead will most likely leave with a box of tasty leftovers. The overall ambiance of the restaurant is warm and welcoming, making it a nice spot to hang with family and friends. Definitely check it out!</p><fig class="- topic/fig "><title class="- topic/title ">Inside Avellinos</title><image href="images/avellinosinside.jpg" class="- topic/image "><alt class="- topic/alt ">Photo of inside of Avellinos, with tables spread out evenly in a fairly decent-sized room.</alt></image></fig><fig class="- topic/fig "><title class="- topic/title ">A Slice of Avellinos' NY Style Pizza</title><image href="images/avellinospizza.jpg" class="- topic/image "><alt class="- topic/alt ">Photo of a classic pepperoni pizza from Avellinos. </alt></image></fig></body></topic>

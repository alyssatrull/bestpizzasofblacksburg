Yes, it may not be a unique, hole-in-the-wall pizza place, as they are everywhere, but they have been successful for a reason. They focus on using high-quality ingredients, including fresh, never-frozen dough, a signature sauce made with vine-ripened tomatoes, and real mozzarella cheese, which the company emphasizes as the key to a superior quality pizza, hence their motto "Better Ingredients, Better Pizza." My favorite pizza to get from them is a pepperoni and green pepper pizza. It always tastes so fresh and delicious. It's yummy, so get it!</p><fig class="- topic/fig "><title class="- topic/title ">Papa John's Pizza</title><image alt="Photo of pizza, with one slice being taken from pizza, cheese strands coming with it and all." href="images/papajohns.jpg" class="- topic/image "><alt class="- topic/alt ">Photo of pizza, with one slice being taken from pizza, cheese strands coming with it and all.</alt></image></fig></body></topic>

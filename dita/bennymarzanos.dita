Building upon the original Benedito's persona, "Marzano's" represents the authenticity of Benny. This comes from the type of tomatoes famously used on pizza, the San Marzano tomato.

Benny Marzano's was our first location, the OG Benny's, aka The Mothership. They opened September 2, 2011 at the fulcrum of the 16 blocks of Downtown Blacksburg. They proudly state that they have "been beaten, broken, but stay true to our roots and keep on cookin'." I will always go back for their beloved, delicious, classic ginormous pizza slices which sets them apart from so many other pizzas spots. Never gets old!</p><fig class="- topic/fig "><title class="- topic/title ">A Benny's Pizza Slice</title><image href="images/bennyspizzaslice.jpg" class="- topic/image "><alt class="- topic/alt ">Photo of pizza slices on plates on a wooden table with other slices also on other plates on the other side of the table.</alt></image></fig></body></topic>
